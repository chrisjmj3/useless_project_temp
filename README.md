# WEIRD RECIPE GENERATOR üéØ

### Project Description
This Weird Recipe Generator rules out conventional culinary styles and takes us to a world of crazy cravings and unimaginable food combinations.Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs proudly useless:
- Defies Nutritional Goals: Users input specific dietary constraints, like low sugar or low cholesterol, and the app generates recipes that intentionally do the opposite‚Äîthink sugary salads or high-cholesterol smoothies!
- Twists Ingredient Intentions: Users enter everyday ingredients expecting sensible recipes, but the app creates bizarre combinations like chocolate curry or pickle-flavored ice cream.
- Zero Practicality: The recipes generated are far from what anyone asked for, making it virtually impossible to follow traditional culinary norms.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The problem we‚Äôre addressing is the overly rigid and predictable nature of conventional recipe generators. Most tools focus strictly on following user constraints like nutritional guidelines or ingredient combinations. This project challenges that norm by offering recipes that intentionally diverge from the constraints provided, exploring unconventional outcomes and expanding the boundaries of creativity in recipe generation.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We're solving it by creating a recipe generator that takes your carefully thought-out ingredient list and nutritional constraints‚Äîthen does the exact opposite. Instead of giving you what you asked for, it flips the script to generate completely unexpected, impractical recipes using the same inputs. It‚Äôs an exploration of what happens when you challenge the rules of traditional recipe creation

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used

- Languages Used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- Frameworks Used: React, Express.js
- Libraries Used: Node.js
- APIs Used: Gemini API (for fetching recipe data)


### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation

# Run

### Project Documentation

The Useless Recipe Generator is a creative web application that redefines how recipes are generated. By taking user-provided ingredients and nutritional constraints, it produces recipes that intentionally go against the specified requirements while still using the same ingredients. This project explores unconventional outcomes, encouraging users to rethink traditional recipe generation norms.

##### Features
- Accepts user-inputted ingredients and nutritional constraints.
- Generates recipes that defy the provided constraints (e.g., high-sugar recipes for low-sugar requests).
- Uses the Gemini API to fetch real-world recipe data as a basis.
- Displays generated recipes in a simple, user-friendly UI.

##### Tools Used
- React for building the user interface.
- Node.js and Express.js for server-side operations.
- Gemini API for recipe retrieval and adaptation.

The final recipe page is displayed, but please note that due to limitations with the Gemini API (frequent failures in key authentication after several prompts), the final recipe is not generated using the Gemini API. Instead, it is created entirely on the frontend.
